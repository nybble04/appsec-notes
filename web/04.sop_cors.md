# Same Origin Policy
- Origin = protocol/scheme + domain + port number.
- The same-origin policy PREVENTS **scripts** on one origin from **reading (NOT writing)** data from another origin.
- This prevents websites from attacking each other.
- Enforced by the browsers.

> NOTE: SOP allows embedding of images via the `<img>` tag, media via the `<video>` tag and JavaScript includes with the `<script>` tag. However, while these external resources can be loaded by the page, **any JavaScript on the page won't be able to read the contents of these resources**. 

## SOP Exceptions
- SOP is relaxed when it comes to cookies. Subdomains can access a domain's cookies even though subdomains are a different origin. To protect from abuse, use `HttpOnly` flags.
- If `marketing.example.com` has to read the contents of `example.com`, both domains need to **set `document.domain` to example.com**. Then SOP will allow access between the two domains despite their different origins. 

# Cross Origin Resource Sharing
- Browser mechanism which enables controlled access to resources located in a different origin.
- Misconfigurations cause vulnerabilities.

## CORS HTTP Headers
```
Access-Control-Allow-Origin
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials
```
- **Access-Control-Allow-Origin** - Indicates whether the response can be read by the specified origin. 
- Can only have _one_ value: `* or <origin> or null`

- **Access-Control-Allow-Credentials** - Indicates whether authenticated response (with cookies) can be read by the origin specified in the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header. 
- Can only have bool values: `true or false`

> NOTE: If `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` then `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` can never be set to true.

> NOTE: If `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: null` then `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` can be set to true. This is the most dangerous option.

## Testing for CORS misconfiguration
- If you see the CORS header `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true` in the response of a request, send it to repeater.

Test1: 
- In the request, change origin to an arbitrary value --> `Origin: http://example.com`. See if the response has `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://example.com`

Test2: 
- In the request, change origin to null --> `Origin: null`. See if the response has `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: null`
- To create a script that executes with origin null, embedd it into a sandbox iframe
```javascript
<iframe style="display: none;" sandbox="allow-scripts" srcdoc=<script>bad_code_here</script> </iframe>
```

Test3: 
- In the request, change origin to the one that _begins with_ , _ends with_ or _contains_ the origin of the site --> `Origin: victim.com.attacker.com` , `Origin: attacker.com.victim.com` , `Origin: attackingvictim.com`
