# Open Redirect Attacks

When a website allows for redirection to an unexpected page, this is called an open redirect. Sometimes applications need to direct the traffic to another page. If a user input can influence the outcome of that redirection, an attacker can force a redirection to a fake or malicious page.

Example:

Assume chrome.com has an open redirect using parameter nextpage: `https://chrome.com?nextpage=https://thankyou.google.com`. An attacker can use this to trick a user into visiting attacker.com by sending the link `https://chrome.com?nextpage=https://attacker.com` or `https://chrome.com?nextpage=https%3A%2F%2Fattacker.com`. The user will most likely click the link because they trust chrome.com.
