# JSON Web Token (JWT) Attacks

> JWT performs AUTHORIZATION not AUTHENTICATION.

> JWT tokens are issued _after_ authentication.

**Why JWT? JWT vs Session Tokens**

Session tokens act as a reference id for client/user information. The use of session tokens is not scalable in large scale systems like microservices or load balanced systems because every server cannot store duplicate information.

JWT is not a reference id, rather a tokenized representation of the information (non sensitive). This token is given to the client by the server. The server signs this information to prevent tampering by the client or any ther malicious actor. JWT is scalabale because the server does not store the information, the client sends everything to it. The server only has to verify the integrity of the information using the signature.

* Server sends JWT in the HTTP Authorization header.
* The client stores the JWT in local storage or cookie storage.

**Parts of JWT**

Base64 encoded parts separated by dot (.)

1. **Header:** Type of the token, algorthim used for signature.
2. **Payload:** The information to be sent to the server.
3. **Signature:** The signature calculated using the algorithm specified in the header. `ALG(base64(header) + '.' + base64(payload) + '.' + secret)`

**JWT Attack techniques:**
1. Sensitive information leakage in the payload.
2. If the JWT token itself is leaked - not using tls, leaked in url parameter or logs. Attacker can reuse this till it expires. If it does not expire, attacker can always reuse it.
3. JWT does not expire on logout. 
4. Change algorithm (RS256 to HS256) or make server not use an algorithm (None).
5. Bruteforce the weak secrets (key) - [hashcat](https://github.com/hashcat) , [jwtbrute](https://github.com/jmaxxz/jwtbrute), [jwtcracker](https://github.com/lmammino/jwt-cracker)
```
hashcat -m 16500 <jwt_token> jwt.secrets.list
```
6. Remove the signature part or provide an invalid signature - works if the server doesn't verify the signature.
7. KID manipulation: the kid is used to specify the key in the payload. Sometimes the path to the key is leaked in this field. Othertimes an attacker can specify their own key here. 
8. JWK header injection: Sign with your private key and send the server your public key using the "jwk" parameter in the header.
9. Look for leaked pem keys. Bruteforce of Path traversal for `jwks.json`.
