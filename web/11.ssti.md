# Server Side Template Injection (SSTI)

**What are templates?**
- Files that contain static content with placeholders to add dynamic content. 
- These placeholders have sepcific syntax based on the **template engine** being used. 

**What is the issue?**
- When the templating engine interprets our input as template code instead of data.
- Using this we can achieve code execution within these placeholders.

**Methodology**
- Look for places where user input is reflected in the ouput. A template could be used.
- Capture the request and send it to Burp Intruder.
- Select Sniper Attack.
- Add a list of payloads for different template engines. Use [hacktricks "Detect Plaintext Context"](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/pentesting-web/ssti-server-side-template-injection)
- In Burp Intruder Options select "grep extract" and insert the message that comes with the reflected input.
- In the intruder results, check if any of the payloads results return "49". This will give the template engine being used.
- Now search for payloads that can be used in this template engine.
