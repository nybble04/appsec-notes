# Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
- User has the ability to modify the URLs to which a system is making requests to.
- These client-side URL modifications are not validated by the server.
- These URLs could be internal or extenal.

Abuse Cases:
- Abusing the trust relation between exterally facing victim with internal systems, to access the internal systems.
- Abusing the trust relation between externally facing victin and 3rd party external system, to perform actions on the 3rd party external system.
- Portscan internal networks of the externally facing server.
- Connect to local services bound to localhost

Bypassing Blacklist:
- Encode the requests. Eg: `127.0.0.1` can be --> `127.1` OR decimal-encoded as `2130706433` OR octal-represented as `017700000001`.

Bypassing libraries that disable calling internal IP addresses:
- DNS Rebinding: Register a domain name that resolves to internal IP address.
- HTTP Redirection: Use your own server that redirects to an internal IP address.

How to prevent?
- Validate all client supplied input data.
- Use a whitelist instead of a blacklist.
- Do not send raw response to the clients.
- Disable HTTP Redirections.
- Network segmentation to prevent port scanning.
- Give the server limited outgoing network access (deny by default) by using firewalls

## Methodology
- Look for requests that contain user controllable URLs (request body, request parameter, custom header, etc.)
- (In-band - Basic) Try changing the url to **localhost**. See if you get the same page, same page with additional functionalities, different page.
- (In-band - Network Scanning) If the URL has an **internal IP address**, you can send it to intruder to bruteforce more IPs.
- (In-band - Dirbusting)- If the URL is to another website, **bruteforce directories** of that website using intruder.
- (Out-band) Try to change the URL to a server that you control.
- Try to URL encode 1 or 2 times to bypass regex based filters. 
- (Open Redirect to SSRF) If a complete URL is not being sent, and only a path is being sent like `/products/tables/productId=1`; **look for open redirects** in any of the web pages of the application. Use this open redirect path in the SSRF payload to make a request to another resource.
